# A brief introduction into neural networks
This guide will give interested people a quick introduction into the basics of neural networks.

## Yet another neural network introduction
With so many descriptions about neural networks around, this one is not different at all. As I wrote my Master's thesis about deep learning, I read a lot about neural networks. The analysis of different types of neural networks, their field of application and their pros and cons gave me a deep insight into the nature of neural networks. Not to say, I am an expert on this field, but I dare say I can give a good introduction to newcomers.

## Applications of neural networks
Neural networks can be applied to different areas. For once there is image process or computer vision. So-called convolutional neural networks can be trained on millions of images to get as close as possible to predict the right output. For instance, training them on input images of [fashion-articles](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) (shoes, shirts, ties, ...) they are able to recognize previously unseen images correctly. Another way to apply neural networks is data-analysis. One can for instance train a neural network to detect a computer virus. Recurrent neural networks can be used, on the other hand, to predict time-series. These are mostly applied in language processing. Given several letters, they are able to predict the next one and the next and so on.
